# Hartree-Fock and MP2 Energy Correction Calculation Program

This project contains a program for calculating the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energies from data and integrals stored in HDF5 format.

## Project Structure

This project is composed of several folders. For instance, the `data` folder has the reference files, the `src` folder contains the source code, the `doc` folder has the documentation covering all aspects of the program, the `tests` foldes contains a set of the example outputs, and the rest consists of files like `AUTHORS`, `INSTALL.md` with the installation instructions, `LICENSE`, as well as the `Makefile` used for the compilation process.

## Documentation

The comprehensive documentation document, generated by Doxygen 1.9.8, is available in the `doc/documentation.pdf` file. The corresponding Doxyfile is also located within the same folder. 

## Installation

The installation steps can be found in the INSTALL.md file.

## Usage

To calculate the Hartree-Fock and MP2 energies, provide the full path to the HDF5 file containing the molecular data and integrals as an argument to the program. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This program works exclusively with the files in HDF5 format, other formats won't produce any results.

Example:
```sh
./HF_and_MP2 data/h2o.h5
```
